          <TD>- I have collected data from Billboard and MusicGraph in order to get the information used in the explorative part of the application.
              <br/>- I have created a measure to calculate the popularity of the various artists that is used to rank them in the various years.
              <br/> - I have extracted the top genres per decades using some heuristic made by me.

          </TD>
                 <TD>
                     - I have created the force graph, using the pictures get from Spotify to represent the artists.
                     <br/>- I have implemented the adding and removing of nodes for the force graph.
                     <br/>- I have added a color system to indicate the player owner of the circle.</TD>
          <TD>- I have connected our application to Echonest and Spotify using the relative APIs.
              <br/>- I have created a Data Manager that handles all of the data get from the API and transform them in a format useful for our application.
              <br/>- I have started to create the timeline chart.   <TD>
          - I have created the entire layout of the application.
          <br/>- I have handled the interactive part of the application, including the suggestion bar, the artists list with possibility of remove them, the change of the view and the "zoom" of the graphs.
          <br/>- I have created the map chart where the artists are plot in their living location.
